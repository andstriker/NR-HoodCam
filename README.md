# NR-HoodCam
Simple mod for Night-Runners that replaces the in-game bumper cam with a hood view (much more useful at 200MPH!)

## Installation
STEP 1: Download <a href="https://melonloader.net/">MelonLoader</a> and its necessary <a href="https://melonwiki.xyz/#/">requirements</a>.

STEP 2: Run the MelonLoader installer and select the NIGHT-RUNNERS executable (.exe) file, then hit 'Install'.

STEP 3: Grab the latest Striker.HoodCam.dll file. You can find it in this repository's Releases tab.

STEP 4: Drag the Striker.HoodCam.dll file into your game directory's 'Mods' folder.

STEP 5: Happy racing!

## Compatibility

Requires MelonLoader 0.6.x to function.

This mod is NOT compatible with versions of Night-Runners Prologue pre-Steam release.

So far I've only tested this mod on the current Steam build of Night-Runners Prologue, but it *should* be compatible with the Patreon build assuming you're able to get ML 0.6.x running on it.
